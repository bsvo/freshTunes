This progress report is from 11/30/23.
- Progress made thusfar: I was able to create a spoitify developers account and sign into it with Spotipy authentication methods. From there I was able to access my playlists by link and iterate through the songs. I was also able to extract song metadata such as the artist, song name & link as well more in-depth audio features such as the Danceability, Acousticness, etc. Was also able to download a large song dataset with every song's audio features.
- Still Remaining: The next part of this project is to compile me & my friends' playlist data and concatenate it with the aforementioned dataset for data aggregation. After that, I'll have to write the code process & standardize the data for the aggregation as well as a user-inputted playlist before feeding features into a cosine similarity matrix to recommend the most similar songs.
- Challenges: When extracting the audio features of me & my friends' playlist data iteratively, I ran into spotify rate limiting issues. A combination of lowering the rate at which requests are made & churning up new spotify developer accounts will be used to alleviate this issue & proceed with data acquisition
