# FreshTunes

### Abstract
FreshTunes aims to be a content-based recommender system that uses the Spotify API to generate a playlist of recommendations based off an existing user-curated playlist. Spotipy is a python library for the Spotify API that can be used to extract from songs basic information such as the artist, popularity, and release date. However, there are many more factors that go into creating a spotify playlist. Spotify playlists are often used to represent a certain "mood" or "feeling" as well, which will is why the advanced audio features such as danceability, key, tempo & tempo will be integral to creating an effective playlist recommender system. The user will 
also be given an option to sift through these attributes & determine which they want to be emphasized in their playlist. This recommender system will be presented in the form of a web application where the user can enter a link to a public spotify playlist, check off features to use in the recommendation & specify the length of the recommended playlist to be returned. After the query is submitted, the recommended playlist will appear with an option to add it to your library. I'm always looking for means of discovering new music, so this app was conceived to aid me in my quest to expand my musical tastes & preferences.
